//  gil_common.tsx — what every screen shares.
//
//  THE PALETTE, THE PARTS, AND THE PLUMBING.  Nothing in here knows
//  what a percept is or what the mind does; it is the vocabulary the
//  screens are written in.
//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
//
//  The two new screens began life with their own copy of the palette
//  and their own H, Chip, Card and Button, because the dashboard
//  exported none of them.  That is a colour defined twice and a card
//  drawn two ways, and the day one is changed and the other is not,
//  the portal stops looking like one thing.
//
//  The division is by WHAT A FILE IS, not by when it was written:
//
//    gil_common.tsx      the palette, the parts, the hooks
//    gil_screens.tsx     the screens that read the KNOWLEDGE BASE
//    gil_dashboard.tsx   the screens that read the MESSAGE record,
//                        and the shell that holds them all
//
//  Anything used by more than one screen belongs here.  Anything used
//  by one belongs with that screen.  That rule is the whole of the
//  maintenance policy, and it is why the duplication cannot come back.
